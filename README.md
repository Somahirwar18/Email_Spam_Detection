Email Spam Detection

I interned at I am ready to share my project with you: This project uses Python to handle text and scikit-learn for machine learning. It starts by turning email content into numbers using TfidfVectorizer. Then, a decision tree learns from these numbers to tell apart spam and real emails. Once trained, the model is saved for quick use later. This project shows skills in Python, text processing, and making computers learn from data. It helps manage emails better by automatically spotting spam.
